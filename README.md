# Conway's Game of Life

Do you want to harness the powers of life and death? Do you see beauty in suffering? Do you think pretty flashing pixels are the best thing ever? **In this repro, you can combine all those loves/complexes with software development.**

For this repro, I've followed a [FreeCodeCamp tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/coding-the-game-of-life-with-react-7de2385b7356//) on Conway's Game of Life.

Based on [John Horton Conway's game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) of the same name, this is a zero-player game that abides by the following rules:
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

This creates a simulation of a population of 'things' (ants, lemmings, humans, whatever). After a while, you get lovely repetitive patterns as the population stablises.
